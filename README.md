# Bank-Management-System
This project is a console/GUI-based application (depending on your version) developed to simulate basic banking operations such as creating new accounts, managing deposits and withdrawals, and viewing account details. It is designed for learning and demonstration purposes, to showcase object-oriented programming.

*FEATURES
1. Creates new Bank account.
2. Deposit and Withdraw money.
3. Fastcash
4. user can also change their pin accorording to itself.
5. Display account statements of transactions.
   
   * Objective
Automate banking operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance checking.
Enable secure and organized management of customer data.
Demonstrate core Java concepts such as classes, inheritance, file handling, or JDBC.

Purpose of the Project
To simulate core banking services in a secure and structured way.
To learn database integration, file handling, and GUI/Console interface using Java and MySQL.
To provide an interactive platform for users to perform basic banking activities.

Scope
This application is intended for:
Students learning Java and software design.
Small-scale banking demos or internal simulations.
Demonstrating file-based or database-backed record keeping.


Advantages of This Project
Teaches full-stack integration (Java + MySQL).
Covers real-world financial system design.
Helps in understanding transaction logging and file/database management.
Offers a base for building large-scale enterprise software.



*Java programming language used for this project (mainly OOPS concept).
*For Data storage "MY SQL" is used.
